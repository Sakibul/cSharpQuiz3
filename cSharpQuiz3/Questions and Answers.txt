Question 4: What is the difference between code-first approach and 
            database-first approach in Entity Framework?



Code-First Approach:

* When there is NO existing database for the application.

* Developer starts writing the entities (domain classes) and 
  context class first and then create the database from these 
  classes using migration commands.

* It has full control over the code rather than database activity.

* All the database operations from the code.



Database-First Approach:

* When database is ready then Entity Framework will complete its duty and create POCO entities.

* Modify the database manually and update model from database.

* It has full control over the database.

* Entity framework can create model classes based on tables and columns from relational database.

Question 5: What is the MVVM design pattern?



Model + View + ViewModel (M-V-VM pattern) is about organizing and 
structuring the code to write maintainable, testable and extensible applications.

* Model − It simply holds the data and has nothing to do with any of the business logic.

* ViewModel − It acts as the link between the Model and View.

* View − It simply holds the formatted data and essentially delegates everything to the Model.
